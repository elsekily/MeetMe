    <h1><b>Graduation Project: </b>(IoT based smart agriculture solution for improving irrigation water efficiency usage)</h1>
    <p>
        The idea is enhancing irrigation water and achieve better utilization efficiency
        than conventional irrigation systems.
        Project employs IoT based solution that captures data from the agricultural land using
        relevant sensors and embedded systems.
        The captured data is then sent to a cloud server to decide the quantity and timing of
        irrigation water.
        We used Raspberry PI as a local broker and hotspot to gather data from NodeMCUs and
        ATMega16 then send it to our broker deployed on a virtual machine on Azure then
        Subscribe it and save into PostgreSQL database and Send to ML then get and publish the
        water amount to the control devices that will irrigate the land.
        Project ranked the <b>third </b>place at JAC-ECC, E-just in DEC, 2018.
        ITIDA Fund the project with <b>4000EGP</b>.
        Grade: A (Excellent).
    </p>
    <h1>Workers Management:</h1>
    <p>
        An Arabic web application to manage and store workers/employees and their
        Attendance and Leaving times then calculating their working duration in hours and their
        salaries. Using ASP.Net MVC 5, HTML, CSS, Ajax and jQuery.
    </p>
    <h1>Nearest ICU Unit:</h1>
    <p>
        The idea is to help patients’ families to find the nearest and empty ICU unit by
        an Android app that captures the location of the user then send it to ASP.Net Core
        Restful API via HTTPs, which searches for the nearest empty hospital in the Database,
        and returns its Location.
    </p>
    <h1>Gas Leakage Alarm:</h1>
    <p>
        Using Arduino and ESP8266 for measuring Gas in the air if it exceeds the
        percentage limit ESP will trigger a HTTPs request to IFTTT, which handles the request
        and send alarm SMS to the user’s mobile phone.
        Project ranked the <b>First </b>place at Pharos Community projects Competition 2018.
    </p>
    <h1>Distance Measuring (Assembly language):</h1>
    <p>
        Using ATMega16, Ultrasonic and 16X2 LCD. Measuring the Time takes ultrasonic
        wave to hit the object using Interruptus and timer then convert it to ASCII String to
        display the distance on the LCD.
    </p>
    <h1>Android Game: (Pick a Card)</h1>
    <p>
        This game tends to show 6 random cards on Mobile Screen then users select a
        card in his mind then app will hide it.
    </p>
    <h1>Home Automation:</h1>
    <p>
        I developed 3 Android apps to publish values of Adafruit Topics via HTTPs and
        MQTT (using Speech to voice or Buttons) and ESPs or NodeMCUs subscribe to these
        topics to control home appliances like (Lights and Doors).
    </p>
    <h1>NRF Robot:</h1>
    <p>
        Using (2) Arduino, (2) NRF module and Joystick Module the controller Arduino
        maps the input of Joystick to a (x,y) plan then transmit it to the receiver Arduino which
        controls a 4 motors car.
